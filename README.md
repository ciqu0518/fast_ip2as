Fast and accurate ip2as

The ip2as mapping is accomplished by https://github.com/hadiasghari/pyasn.git

In this repository, we just provide a faster and more convenient way to obtain the mapping database. We use the routeviews Prefix-to-AS mappings (pfx2as) for IPv4 and IPv6 provided by CAIDA to generate the database. 

You can download the pfx2as files from https://publicdata.caida.org/datasets/routing/routeviews-prefix2as/
