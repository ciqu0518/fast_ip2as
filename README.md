# fast_ip2as
Fast and accurate ip2as
The ip2as mapping is accomplished by https://github.com/hadiasghari/pyasn.git
In this repository, we just provide a faster and more convenient way to obtain the mapping database. We use the routeviews Prefix-to-AS mappings (pfx2as) for IPv4 and IPv6 provided by CAIDA to generate the database.
